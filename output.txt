X-Frame-Options: This HTTP response header improves the protection of web applications against clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks.","CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are: 
X-Frame-Options: 
Apache: Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN 
nginx: add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN; 
HAProxy: rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN 
IIS: <HTTPPROTOCOL><CUSTOMHEADERS><ADD NAME=""X-Frame-Options"" VALUE=""SAMEORIGIN""></ADD></CUSTOMHEADERS></HTTPPROTOCOL> 
X-XSS-Protection: 
Apache: Header always set X-XSS-Protection ""1; mode=block""  
PHP: header(""X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block""); 
X-Content-Type-Options: 
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
HTTP Strict-Transport-Security: 
Apache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security ""max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"" 
Nginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000; 
  Note: Network devices that include a HTTP/HTTPS console for administrative/management purposes often do not include all/some of the security headers. This is a known issue and it is recommend to contact the vendor for a solution.",,,"Strict-Transport-Security HTTP Header missing on port 443.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks.","CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are: 
X-Frame-Options: 
Apache: Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN 
nginx: add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN; 
HAProxy: rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN 
IIS: <HTTPPROTOCOL><CUSTOMHEADERS><ADD NAME=""X-Frame-Options"" VALUE=""SAMEORIGIN""></ADD></CUSTOMHEADERS></HTTPPROTOCOL> 
X-XSS-Protection: 
Apache: Header always set X-XSS-Protection ""1; mode=block""  
PHP: header(""X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block""); 
X-Content-Type-Options: 
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
HTTP Strict-Transport-Security: 
Apache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security ""max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"" 
Nginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000;

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

For example if TLSv1.0 uses either the RC4 stream cipher, or a block cipher in CBC mode. 
RC4 is known to have biases and the block cipher in CBC mode is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. 
TLSv1.0, if configured to use the same cipher suites as SSLv3, includes a means by which a TLS implementation can downgrade the connection to SSL v3.0, thus weakening security. 
A POODLE-type (https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2014/12/08/poodle-bites-tls) attack could also be launched directly at TLS without negotiating a downgrade. 
  This QID is an automatic PCI FAIL in accordance with the PCI standards.  
Further details can be found under:  
PCI: ASV Program Guide v3.1 (page 27) (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/ASV_Program_Guide_v3.1.pdf) 
PCI: Use of SSL Early TLS and ASV Scans (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Use-of-SSL-Early-TLS-and-ASV-Scans.pdf)","An attacker can exploit cryptographic flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle type attacks or to decryption communications. 
For example: An attacker could force a downgrade from the TLS protocol to the older SSLv3.0 protocol and exploit the POODLE vulnerability, read secure communications or maliciously modify messages.

A PCI scan must be allowed to perform scanning without interference from intrusion detection systems or intrusion prevention systems.  
The PCI ASV is required to post fail if scan interference is detected. 
The goal of this QID is to ensure that Active Protection Systems are not blocking, filtering, dropping or modifying network packets from a PCI Certified Scan, as such behavior could affect an ASV's ability to detect vulnerabilities. Active Protection Systems could include any of the following; IPS, WAF, Firewall, NGF, QoS Device, Spam Filter, etc. which are dynamically modifying their behavior based on info gathered from traffic patterns. This QID is triggered if a well known and popular service is not identified correctly due to possible scan interference. Services like FTP, SSH, Telnet, DNS, HTTP and Database services like MSSQL, Oracle, MySql are included.
-If an Active Protection System is found to be preventing the scan from completing, Merchants should make the required changes (e.g. whitelist) so that the ASV scan can complete unimpeded.
-If the scan was not actively blocked, Merchants can submit a PCI False Positive/Exception Request with a statement asserting that No Active Protection System is present or blocking the scan.
Additionally, if there is no risk to the Cardholder Data Environment, such as no web service running, this can also be submitted as a PCI False Positive/Exception Request and reviewed per the standard PCI Workflow.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

For example if TLSv1.0 uses either the RC4 stream cipher, or a block cipher in CBC mode. 
RC4 is known to have biases and the block cipher in CBC mode is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. 
TLSv1.0, if configured to use the same cipher suites as SSLv3, includes a means by which a TLS implementation can downgrade the connection to SSL v3.0, thus weakening security.

It has been reported that in some versions of the Linux kernel IP stack implementation as well as other operating systems, UDP packets are transmitted with a constant IP Identification field of 0.","By exploiting this vulnerability, a malicious user can discover the operating system and approximate kernel version of the host.

A PCI scan must be allowed to perform scanning without interference from intrusion detection systems or intrusion prevention systems.  
The PCI ASV is required to post fail if scan interference is detected. 
The goal of this QID is to ensure that Active Protection Systems are not blocking, filtering, dropping or modifying network packets from a PCI Certified Scan, as such behavior could affect an ASV's ability to detect vulnerabilities. Active Protection Systems could include any of the following; IPS, WAF, Firewall, NGF, QoS Device, Spam Filter, etc. which are dynamically modifying their behavior based on info gathered from traffic patterns. This QID is triggered if a well known and popular service is not identified correctly due to possible scan interference. Services like FTP, SSH, Telnet, DNS, HTTP and Database services like MSSQL, Oracle, MySql are included.
-If an Active Protection System is found to be preventing the scan from completing, Merchants should make the required changes (e.g. whitelist) so that the ASV scan can complete unimpeded.
-If the scan was not actively blocked, Merchants can submit a PCI False Positive/Exception Request with a statement asserting that No Active Protection System is present or blocking the scan.
Additionally, if there is no risk to the Cardholder Data Environment, such as no web service running, this can also be submitted as a PCI False Positive/Exception Request and reviewed per the standard PCI Workflow.
For more details on scan interference during a PCI scan please refer to  ASV Scan Interference  section of PCI DSS Approved Scanning Vendors Program Guide Version 2.0 May 2013 - page 14/28 (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/ASV_Program_Guide_v2.pdf).","If the scanner cannot detect vulnerabilities on Internet-facing systems because the scan is blocked by an IDS/IPS, those vulnerabilities will remain uncorrected and may be exploited if the IDS/IPS changes or fails.","Whitelist the Qualys scanner to scan without interference from the IDS or IPS.",,,"Service name: Unknown - Possible Scan Interference on TCP port 443.","yes",,"General remote services"

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

Apache is vulnerable to a denial of service due to holding a connection open for partial HTTP requests. 
Apache Versions 1.x and 2.x are vulnerable.","A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against the Web server which would prevent legitimate users from accessing the site. 
Denial of service tools and scripts such as Slowloris takes advantage of this vulnerability.","Patch - 
There are no vendor-supplied patches available at this time.
Workaround: - Server-specific recommendations can be found here (https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2011/11/02/how-to-protect-against-slow-http-attacks). 
- Countermeasures for Apache are described here (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/misc/security_tips.htmldos). 
- Reverse proxies, load balancers and iptables can help to prevent this attack from occurring. 
- Adjusting the TimeOut Directive (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.htmltimeout) can also prevent this attack from occurring. 
- A new module mod_reqtimeout (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_reqtimeout.html) has been introduced since Apache 2.2.15 to provide tools for mitigation against these forms of attack.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

The result is given in the Result section below.

A PCI scan must be allowed to perform scanning without interference from intrusion detection systems or intrusion prevention systems.  
The PCI ASV is required to post fail if scan interference is detected. 
The goal of this QID is to ensure that Active Protection Systems are not blocking, filtering, dropping or modifying network packets from a PCI Certified Scan, as such behavior could affect an ASV's ability to detect vulnerabilities. Active Protection Systems could include any of the following; IPS, WAF, Firewall, NGF, QoS Device, Spam Filter, etc. which are dynamically modifying their behavior based on info gathered from traffic patterns. This QID is triggered if a well known and popular service is not identified correctly due to possible scan interference. Services like FTP, SSH, Telnet, DNS, HTTP and Database services like MSSQL, Oracle, MySql are included.
-If an Active Protection System is found to be preventing the scan from completing, Merchants should make the required changes (e.g. whitelist) so that the ASV scan can complete unimpeded.
-If the scan was not actively blocked, Merchants can submit a PCI False Positive/Exception Request with a statement asserting that No Active Protection System is present or blocking the scan.
Additionally, if there is no risk to the Cardholder Data Environment, such as no web service running, this can also be submitted as a PCI False Positive/Exception Request and reviewed per the standard PCI Workflow.
For more details on scan interference during a PCI scan please refer to  ASV Scan Interference  section of PCI DSS Approved Scanning Vendors Program Guide Version 2.0 May 2013 - page 14/28 (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/ASV_Program_Guide_v2.pdf).","If the scanner cannot detect vulnerabilities on Internet-facing systems because the scan is blocked by an IDS/IPS, those vulnerabilities will remain uncorrected and may be exploited if the IDS/IPS changes or fails.","Whitelist the Qualys scanner to scan without interference from the IDS or IPS.",,,"Service name: Unknown - Possible Scan Interference on TCP port 443.","yes",,"General remote services"

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

The server treats the client's initial TLS handshake as a renegotiation and thus believes that the initial data transmitted by the attacker is from the same entity as the subsequent client data. TLS protocol was extended to cryptographically tierenegotiations to the TLS connections they are being performed over. This is referred to as TLS secure renegotiation extension.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

The result is given in the Result section below.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

The result is given in the Result section below.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

For example if TLSv1.0 uses either the RC4 stream cipher, or a block cipher in CBC mode. 
RC4 is known to have biases and the block cipher in CBC mode is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. 
TLSv1.0, if configured to use the same cipher suites as SSLv3, includes a means by which a TLS implementation can downgrade the connection to SSL v3.0, thus weakening security. 
A POODLE-type (https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2014/12/08/poodle-bites-tls) attack could also be launched directly at TLS without negotiating a downgrade. 
  This QID is an automatic PCI FAIL in accordance with the PCI standards.  
Further details can be found under:  
PCI: ASV Program Guide v3.1 (page 27) (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/ASV_Program_Guide_v3.1.pdf) 
PCI: Use of SSL Early TLS and ASV Scans (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Use-of-SSL-Early-TLS-and-ASV-Scans.pdf)","An attacker can exploit cryptographic flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle type attacks or to decryption communications. 
For example: An attacker could force a downgrade from the TLS protocol to the older SSLv3.0 protocol and exploit the POODLE vulnerability, read secure communications or maliciously modify messages. 
A POODLE-type (https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2014/12/08/poodle-bites-tls) attack could also be launched directly at TLS without negotiating a downgrade.","Disable the use of TLSv1.0 protocol in favor of a cryptographically stronger protocol such as TLSv1.2.

"217.68.244.53","No registered hostname",,"Windows Vista / Windows 2008","host scanned, found vuln","11827","HTTP Security Header Not Detected","Vuln","2","443","tcp",,,,,,"This QID reports the absence of the following HTTP headers (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Headers_Projecttab=Headers) according to CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html): 
X-Frame-Options: This HTTP response header improves the protection of web applications against clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks.","CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are: 
X-Frame-Options: 
Apache: Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN 
nginx: add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN; 
HAProxy: rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN 
IIS: <HTTPPROTOCOL><CUSTOMHEADERS><ADD NAME=""X-Frame-Options"" VALUE=""SAMEORIGIN""></ADD></CUSTOMHEADERS></HTTPPROTOCOL> 
X-XSS-Protection: 
Apache: Header always set X-XSS-Protection ""1; mode=block""  
PHP: header(""X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block""); 
X-Content-Type-Options: 
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
HTTP Strict-Transport-Security: 
Apache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security ""max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"" 
Nginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000; 
  Note: Network devices that include a HTTP/HTTPS console for administrative/management purposes often do not include all/some of the security headers.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

This means that instead of using the ""Keep-Alive"" method to keep the TCP connection alive over multiple requests, the protocol allows multiple HTTP URL requests to be made in the same TCP packet. Any Web server which is HTTP 1.1 compliant should then process all the URLs requested in the single TCP packet and respond as usual.

This issue presents itself when TCP packets with invalid checksums are routed through the device. As a packet traverses the device, connection state is setup and further traffic with the same source and destination IP address and port combination will be blocked, as it will have invalid sequence numbers compared to the attacker's initial packet.
The triggering packet is a SYN packet and a full three-way handshake is not required, allowing attackers to spoof arbitrary source and destination IP addresses and ports. By sending enough packets to block all 65535 possible source ports for a targeted service, attackers may completely block new traffic for the service.
Various Cisco PIX versions between 2.7 through 6.3 and 7.0 through 7.0(2) are vulnerable.","Successful exploitation allows attackers to temporarily block network traffic to arbitrarily targeted TCP services. By repeating the attack, a prolonged denial of service condition is possible.","Cisco has released fixes to address this issue. See this 
Cisco Security Advisory (http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sr-20060307-pix.shtml) for information on how to obtain and apply these fixes.","Source: The Exploit-DB

A PCI scan must be allowed to perform scanning without interference from intrusion detection systems or intrusion prevention systems.  
The PCI ASV is required to post fail if scan interference is detected. 
The goal of this QID is to ensure that Active Protection Systems are not blocking, filtering, dropping or modifying network packets from a PCI Certified Scan, as such behavior could affect an ASV's ability to detect vulnerabilities. Active Protection Systems could include any of the following; IPS, WAF, Firewall, NGF, QoS Device, Spam Filter, etc. which are dynamically modifying their behavior based on info gathered from traffic patterns. This QID is triggered if a well known and popular service is not identified correctly due to possible scan interference. Services like FTP, SSH, Telnet, DNS, HTTP and Database services like MSSQL, Oracle, MySql are included.
-If an Active Protection System is found to be preventing the scan from completing, Merchants should make the required changes (e.g. whitelist) so that the ASV scan can complete unimpeded.
-If the scan was not actively blocked, Merchants can submit a PCI False Positive/Exception Request with a statement asserting that No Active Protection System is present or blocking the scan.
Additionally, if there is no risk to the Cardholder Data Environment, such as no web service running, this can also be submitted as a PCI False Positive/Exception Request and reviewed per the standard PCI Workflow.
For more details on scan interference during a PCI scan please refer to  ASV Scan Interference  section of PCI DSS Approved Scanning Vendors Program Guide Version 2.0 May 2013 - page 14/28 (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/ASV_Program_Guide_v2.pdf).","If the scanner cannot detect vulnerabilities on Internet-facing systems because the scan is blocked by an IDS/IPS, those vulnerabilities will remain uncorrected and may be exploited if the IDS/IPS changes or fails.","Whitelist the Qualys scanner to scan without interference from the IDS or IPS.",,,"Service name: Unknown - Possible Scan Interference on TCP port 22.","yes",,"General remote services"

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

The Host Scan Time does not have a direct correlation to the Duration time as displayed in the Report Summary section of a scan results report. The Duration is the period of time it takes the service to perform a scan task. The Duration includes the time it takes the service to scan all hosts, which may involve parallel scanning. It also includes the time it takes for a scanner appliance to pick up the scan task and transfer the results back to the service's Secure Operating Center. Further, when a scan task is distributed across multiple scanners, the Duration includes the time it takes to perform parallel host scanning on all scanners.

This (false positive on UDP open ports) may happen when the firewall is configured to reject UDP packets for most (but not all) ports with an ICMP Port Unreachable packet.
